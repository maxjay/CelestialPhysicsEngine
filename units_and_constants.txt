SI Units:
Distance = AU (Astronomical unit)
Mass = M_s (Solar mass)
Time = s (Unchanged)

Constant:
G = 3.965e-12
c = 2.004e-3


s += a (= force/mass)


force = kgms^-2
force * speed_scale^2

speed_scale = 21600**2


1 frame = 1 hour




100 pixels = 1 AU
100 pixels = 1.496e^11 meters
=> 1 pixel = 1.496e^9 meters


km/s => km/hour * 6
